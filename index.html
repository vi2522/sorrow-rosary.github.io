        <h3>First Sorrowful Mystery: The Agony in the Garden</h3>
        <p><i>Ask for a grace of perfect sorrow for our sins and the virtue of perfect obedience to God's will.</i></p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <i>Matthew 26: 36-46</i> <br>
            Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, “Sit here while I go 
            over there and pray.” He took along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to feel sorrow and distress.
            Then he said to them, “My soul is sorrowful even to death. Remain here and keep watch with me.” He advanced 
            a little and fell prostrate in prayer, saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet, 
            not as I will, but as you will.” When he returned to his disciples he found them asleep. He said to Peter, “So 
            you could not keep watch with me for one hour? Watch and pray that you may not undergo the test. The spirit is 
            willing, but the flesh is weak.” Withdrawing a second time, he prayed again, “My Father, if it is not possible 
            that this cup pass without my drinking it, your will be done!” Then he returned once more and found them asleep, 
            for they could not keep their eyes open. He left them and withdrew again and prayed a third time, saying the same 
            thing again. Then he returned to his disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? 
            Behold, the hour is at hand when the Son of Man is to be handed over to sinners. Get up, let us go. Look, my 
            betrayer is at hand.”

        <h3>Second Sorrowful Mystery: The Scourging at the Pillar</h3>
        <p><i>Ask for a grace to mortify our senses perfectly.</i></p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <i>John 19: 1-16</i> <br>
            Then Pilate took Jesus and had him scourged. And the soldiers wove a crown out of thorns and placed it on his head, and clothed 
            him in a purple cloak, and they came to him and said, “Hail, King of the Jews!” And they struck him repeatedly. Once more Pilate 
            went out and said to them, “Look, I am bringing him out to you, so that you may know that I find no guilt in him.” So Jesus came 
            out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple cloak. And he said to them, “Behold, the man!” When the chief priests and the 
            guards saw him they cried out, “Crucify him, crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves and crucify him. I find no 
            guilt in him.” The Jews answered, “We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of 
            God.” Now when Pilate heard this statement, he became even more afraid, and went back into the praetorium and said to Jesus, “Where 
            are you from?” Jesus did not answer him. So Pilate said to him, “Do you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release 
            you and I have power to crucify you?” Jesus answered [him], “You would have no power over me if it had not been given to you from 
            above. For this reason the one who handed me over to you has the greater sin.” Consequently, Pilate tried to release him; but the 
            Jews cried out, “If you release him, you are not a Friend of Caesar. Everyone who makes himself a king opposes Caesar.” When Pilate 
            heard these words he brought Jesus out and seated him on the judge’s bench in the place called Stone Pavement, in Hebrew, Gabbatha. 
            It was preparation day for Passover, and it was about noon. And he said to the Jews, “Behold, your king!” They cried out, “Take him 
            away, take him away! Crucify him!” Pilate said to them, “Shall I crucify your king?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king but 
            Caesar.” Then he handed him over to them to be crucified.

        <h3>Third Sorrowful Mystery: The Crowning with Thorns</h3>
        <p><i>Ask for a grace of great contempt of the world.</i></p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <i>Matthew 27: 27-31</i> <br>
            Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus inside the praetorium and gathered the whole cohort around him. They stripped off his clothes 
            and threw a scarlet military cloak about him. Weaving a crown out of thorns, they placed it on his head, and a reed in his right hand. And 
            kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” They spat upon him and took the reed and kept striking him on the head.
            And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the cloak, dressed him in his own clothes, and led him off to crucify him.

        <h3>Fourth Sorrowful Mystery: The Carrying of the Cross</h3>
        <p><i>Ask for a grace to give us great patience in carrying our cross in God's footsteps everyday of our life.</i></p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <i>Luke 23: 26-32</i> <br>
            As they led him away they took hold of a certain Simon, a Cyrenian, who was coming in from the country; and after laying the cross on him, they 
            made him carry it behind Jesus. A large crowd of people followed Jesus, including many women who mourned and lamented him. Jesus turned to them 
            and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me; weep instead for yourselves and for your children, for indeed, the days are coming when 
            people will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed.’ At that time people will say to the mountains, 
            ‘Fall upon us!’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us!’ for if these things are done when the wood is green what will happen when it is dry?” Now two others, 
            both criminals, were led away with him to be executed.

        <h3>Fifth Sorrowful Mystery: The Crucifixion and Death of Jesus</h3>
        <p><i>Ask for a grace of a holy death for us and for those who are now in their last agony.</i></p>
        <hr>
        <p>
            <i>John 19: 17-30</i> <br>
            So they took Jesus, and carrying the cross himself he went out to what is called the Place of the Skull, in Hebrew, Golgotha. There they crucified him, 
            and with him two others, one on either side, with Jesus in the middle. Pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross. It read, “Jesus the 
            Nazorean, the King of the Jews.” Now many of the Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was 
            written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek. So the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write ‘The King of the Jews,’ but that he said, ‘I am the 
            King of the Jews.’” Pilate answered, “What I have written, I have written.” When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them 
            into four shares, a share for each soldier. They also took his tunic, but the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top down. So they said to one 
            another, “Let’s not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it will be,” in order that the passage of scripture might be fulfilled [that says]: “They 
            divided my garments among them, and for my vesture they cast lots.” This is what the soldiers did. Standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother and his 
            mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala. When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple there whom he loved, he said to his mother, “Woman, 
            behold, your son.” Then he said to the disciple, “Behold, your mother.” And from that hour the disciple took her into his home. After this, aware that everything 
            was now finished, in order that the scripture might be fulfilled, Jesus said, “I thirst.” There was a vessel filled with common wine. So they put a sponge soaked 
            in wine on a sprig of hyssop and put it up to his mouth. When Jesus had taken the wine, he said, “It is finished.” And bowing his head, he handed over the spirit.
